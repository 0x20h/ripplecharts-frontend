      <p>
        The current order book for the selected currency pair is below - 
        these are orders that have been placed but not filled yet. 
        Bids are orders to buy the base currency, and asks are orders 
        to sell the base currency. The “total” column shows the total 
        amount of currency you could get at that price. The blue line 
        shows the depth of the order book, and the vertical line represents
        the midpoint between the best bid and ask price.
